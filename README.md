# Cloud Security Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance security within an AWS cloud environment by implementing best practices for securing data, networks, and encryption keys. The project challenges you to apply AWS security concepts and services, focusing on securing access to resources and monitoring activity within the cloud.

### Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Secure access to objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Secure network access to your virtual network.
- Encrypt data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) on an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume.
- Manage encryption keys using AWS KMS.
- Create a monitoring and incident response system using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Config.

---

## AWS Service Restrictions
In this environment, access to AWS services is restricted to those required to complete the project. Attempting to access other services or perform actions outside the lab scope may result in errors.

## Scenario
As a cloud security specialist at AnyCompany Financial Bank, you are responsible for ensuring the security of AWS cloud resources. The company handles sensitive personal information and financial data, requiring strict security measures.

Key security concerns include:
- Securing Amazon S3 buckets
- Protecting the network hosting web servers
- Managing encryption keys to secure data

## Solution Requirements
The project is divided into different phases, each addressing specific security requirements:

| Phase | Detail | Requirements |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **1** | **Securing Data in Amazon S3** - Implement security features such as bucket policies, object versioning, inventory logging, and object-level logging. | R3, R7 |
| **2** | **Securing VPCs** - Implement security measures like VPC flow logs, route table configurations, network ACLs, and firewalls. | R1, R2, R3, R6 |
| **3** | **Securing AWS Resources with AWS KMS** - Use KMS to encrypt S3 data, EBS volumes, Secrets Manager, and KMS envelope encryption. | R3, R5 |
| **4** | **Monitoring and Logging** - Implement security features in CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and AWS Config to log and monitor activity. | R4, R7, R8 |

## AWS Setup Instructions
To start this project in AWS, follow these steps:

1. **Set up an AWS Account:**
   - Ensure you have an active AWS account with the necessary permissions.

2. **Secure S3 Buckets:**
   - Enable bucket policies and block public access.
   - Enable object versioning and access logging.
   - Configure AWS CloudTrail to log object-level API activity.

3. **Secure Network with VPC:**
   - Configure VPC subnets, security groups, and network ACLs.
   - Enable VPC flow logs to monitor network traffic.
   - Implement firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.

4. **Encrypt Data using AWS KMS:**
   - Create a KMS customer-managed key (CMK) for encrypting data.
   - Apply KMS encryption to S3 objects, EBS volumes, and Secrets Manager.

5. **Implement Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail for account activity tracking.
   - Configure AWS CloudWatch for security event monitoring.
   - Use AWS Config to track resource compliance and changes.

## Key AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3**: Secure storage for sensitive data.
- **Amazon VPC**: Isolated networking environment.
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**: Data encryption and key management.
- **Amazon CloudTrail**: Logging of API activity.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and alerting.
- **AWS Config**: Compliance tracking and change management.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience in securing cloud environments using AWS security best practices. By completing the phases, you will gain practical skills in access control, network security, encryption, and monitoring.
